# First Landing Page üìñ

Most of the content I studied is in the project. In **HTML**, some tags/concepts worth mentioning are:

* Semantics
* Form
* List (ol/ul)
* Table

As for **CSS**, these are some of the interesting ones:

* Animations
* Responsive Design
* Media Queries
* Pseudo-elements
* Pseudo-classes
* Flexbox
* Grid

The landing page originates from this free course on Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbIBj8vQhvm00J3f3rD33tRuNLem8EgEA (kudos to teacher Ot√°vio ‚ù§Ô∏è). Instead of just copying what would be instructed, I analyzed the page final result and, in order to reproduce it, developed the project by myself.
